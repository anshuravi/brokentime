Enter a broken universe as you race through history, avoid the obstacles along the way and return to your original timeline before time runs out.
## About
This project is a side scrolling game with pong-like controls. It is based on my love for science fiction and history. The purpose is to remind us how despite how times have changed, humanity will always make the same mistakes.
## Software
This game was created with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [p5.play](http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) libraries.
## Timeline
The assets and art for this game will be done by April 17th. Following this, the overall code and functionality will be complete by the 21st of April. Debugging will be finished by April 24th. Lastly, any additional features will be out by the 27th of April.
